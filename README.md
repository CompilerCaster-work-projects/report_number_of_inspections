# customer_segmentation
## Description
In this task, we needed to make a report for the manager, which should include:
A clear visualization of how the number of non-admissions in certain organizations (I was provided with their tax identification number) changed over time
## How to run and get result
Using the ```script.js``` file, I exported the number of inspections that were resolved by a person and which were designated as non-admission in each required organization by day, and then using Excel methods I made calculations and visualizations. I know that Mongo has a function that allows you to immediately group the result by week. But the fact is that the Russian week begins on Monday, and not on Sunday (as in Mongo). Therefore, it was decided to make all calculations only in Excel.
